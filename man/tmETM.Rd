\title{Generation of rooted binary trees under the equiprobable-types-model (ETM)}
\usage{
genETMTree(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer value that specifies the desired number of leaves, i.e.,
vertices with in-degree 1 and out-degree 0.}
}
\value{
\code{genETMTree} A single tree of class \code{phylo} is returned.
}
\description{
\code{genETMTree} - Generates a rooted binary tree in \code{phylo}
format with the given number of \code{n} leaves under the
equiprobable-types-model.
Given \code{n}, all tree shapes/topologies with \code{n} leaves are
equiprobable under the ETM.\cr
Due to the restrictions of the \code{phylo} or \code{multiphylo} format
the number of leaves must be at least 2 since there must be at
least one edge.
}
\examples{
genETMTree(n = 5)
