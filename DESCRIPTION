Description: The first goal of this package is to provide a multitude of tree models,
    i.e., functions that generate rooted binary trees with a given number of leaves.
    Second, the package allows for an easy evaluation and comparison of tree shape
    statistics by estimating their power to differentiate between different tree models.
    Please note that this R package was developed alongside the manuscript
    "Tree balance in phylogenetic models" by
    S. J. Kersting, K. Wicke, and M. Fischer (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.05185>,
    which provides further background and the respective mathematical definitions.
    This project was supported by the project ArtIGROW, which is a part of the
    WIR!-Alliance ArtIFARM â€“  Artificial Intelligence in Farming funded by the
    German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (No. 03WIR4805).
